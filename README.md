Our demo app to test and demonstrate bots we are building. 

You can find here very simple dron eCommerce application and 3 level of tests:
1. Standard automated functional regression testing in implemented in Playwright with TypeScript 
2. Wopee assistant: Standard automated functional regression testing assisted by autonomous visual regression testing assistant.
